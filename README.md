# ReFi Conservation DAO: Empowering Ecological Projects with Confidential Voting ðŸŒ±

ReFi Conservation DAO is an innovative decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that utilizes **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to fund and support ecological conservation projects worldwide. By enabling confidential voting mechanisms, this project ensures sensitive geographical and species data remains private while allowing community members to vote on funding initiatives. 

## Addressing Environmental Challenges

In today's world, ecological conservation projects face numerous challenges, primarily concerning data privacy and transparency. Sensitive information about endangered species and ecological sites must be protected while ensuring that funding decisions are made transparently and democratically. Traditional funding models often lack the necessary privacy features, allowing external parties to exploit sensitive data.

## Harnessing FHE for Confidentiality

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides an elegant solution to this problem. Leveraging libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, the ReFi Conservation DAO encrypts proposals containing sensitive data, allowing DAO members to vote confidentially. This ensures that while the community can participate in crucial funding decisions, the potentially exploitable specifics of ecological data remain shielded from prying eyes. 

By implementing Zama's open-source tools, we are able to maintain a high level of transparency and integrity in funding while safeguarding precious environmental data.

## Core Features

- **Sensitive Data Encryption:** Proposals submitted to the DAO are FHE encrypted, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive geographical locations and species information.
- **Confidential Voting:** DAO members can privately vote on funding initiatives, promoting trust while protecting sensitive information.
- **Direct Funding Mechanism:** Funds are allocated transparently to frontline conservation projects, ensuring that financial resources directly impact ecological efforts.
- **Community Governance:** DAO members are empowered to propose and vote on new projects, fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment.

## Technology Stack

The ReFi Conservation DAO is built upon a robust technology stack that includes:

- **Solidity** for smart contracts
- **Node.js** for backend services
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for development and testing
- **Zama's FHE SDK** as the core library for confidential computing
- **Ethereum blockchain** for deployment and DAO interactions

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an overview of the directory structure of the project:

```
/ReFi_Conservation_DAO
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ReFi_Conservation_DAO.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deploy.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vote.js
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ReFiConservationDAOTests.js
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ hardhat.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the ReFi Conservation DAO project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will fetch all necessary libraries, including Zama's FHE libraries.

**IMPORTANT**: Please refrain from using `git clone` or any URLs to download the project directly.

## Building and Running the Project

To compile the smart contracts, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

You can run tests to ensure everything works smoothly by executing:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

To deploy the DAO smart contracts to your local Ethereum network, you can use:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Feel free to adapt the configuration for your preferred Ethereum network!

## Example Code Snippet

Below is a code snippet showcasing how a project proposal might be structured and submitted for voting:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ReFi_Conservation_DAO.sol";

contract ProjectProposal {
    string public proposalName;
    string public encryptedData;
    address public proposer;

    constructor(string memory _proposalName, string memory _encryptedData) {
        proposalName = _proposalName;
        encryptedData = _encryptedData;
        proposer = msg.sender;
    }

    function submitProposal() public {
        // Logic to submit the proposal to the DAO
        // This would call a function in the ReFi_Conservation_DAO contract
    }
}
```

This shows how proposals are created and prepared for submission to the DAO, highlighting the importance of encryption in protecting sensitive data.
